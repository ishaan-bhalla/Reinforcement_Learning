   - **Algorithm**: First-Visit Monte Carlo
   - **Description**: Implements the First-Visit Monte Carlo method for learning the value function in a Blackjack environment.

2. **Calculating Probabilities**:

   - **Algorithm**: Probability Calculations
   - **Description**: Focuses on calculating probabilities, fundamental in reinforcement learning.

3. **Correlation Analysis Projects**:

   - **Algorithm**: Correlation Analysis
   - **Description**: Analyzes relationships between different variables in datasets.

4. **Q-Learning Implementation**:

   - **Algorithm**: Q-Learning
   - **Description**: Implements the Q-Learning algorithm for model-free reinforcement learning.

5. **Thompson Sampling**:

   - **Algorithm**: Thompson Sampling
   - **Description**: Implements the Thompson Sampling algorithm for multi-armed bandit problems.

6. **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**:

   - **Algorithm**: UCB
   - **Description**: Implements the UCB algorithm for balancing exploration and exploitation in multi-armed bandit problems.

7. **Markov Chains**:

   - **Algorithm**: Markov Chains
   - **Description**: Explores Markov Chains, a key concept in reinforcement learning.

8. **Policy and Value Iteration**:
   - **Algorithms**: Policy Iteration and Value Iteration

### Datasets Used

1. **Ads Optimisation Dataset** (`Ads_Optimisation.csv`):

   - Used in the **Thompson Sampling** and **UCB** projects.
   - Contains data used to simulate ad selection scenarios for optimizing ad displays.

2. **Student Performance Dataset (Math)** (`student-mat.csv`):

   - Used in correlation analysis projects to study relationships between different attributes and student performance in math courses.

3. **Student Performance Dataset (Portuguese)** (`student-por.csv`):
   - Similar to the math dataset, used to study relationships between different attributes and student performance in Portuguese courses.

### Education

All the concepts and algorithms implemented in these projects were taught as part of my course at Northcap University. The course provided a comprehensive understanding of reinforcement learning and statistical analysis, which I have applied in these projects.
